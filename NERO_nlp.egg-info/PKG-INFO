Description: NERO is a biomedical Named Entity (Recognition) Ontology.
        
        
        Using NERO, we annotated a large biomedical corpus to enable a broad spectrum of natural language processing and
        biomedical machine learning tasks.
        
        
        NERO-nlp is a wrapper around this corpus.
        
        
        Sample usage:
        
        
        	In [3]: from NERO.corpus import corpus
        
        	# Directly access basic dataframe attributes
        	In [4]: corpus.columns 
        
        	In [5]: corpus.shape
        
        	# access to the whole dataframe
        	In [6]: corpus._data
        
        	# Having directly access to columns by calling them as an attribute
        	In [7]: corpus.semantic_class_actionType
        
        	In [8]:                                                                                                                                                                                                     
        
        	# Using documentation 
        	In [8]: corpus.procset_topic_bd.__doc__                                                                                                                                                        
        
        	# other generic and multipurpose functions
        	In [9]: corpus.procset_topic_bd('aut')                                                                                                                                                               
        
        	In [10]: corpus.plot_protein_domain_entity() 
        
        
        
        Installation:
        
        For running the NERO-nlp you need to have python3.7+ and pandas installed. For installation you can use `pip` or `pip3` for installation. 
        
            # Install
        	sudo pip3 install NERO-nlp
        	# or
        	sudo python3 -m pip install NERO-nlp
        	# Upgrade
        	sudo pip3 install NERO-nlp --upgrade
